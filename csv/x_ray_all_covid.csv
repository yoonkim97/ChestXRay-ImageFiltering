He had a meaningful past medical history, due to history of atrial fibrillation (resolved at the time of hospitalization), hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, associated with multiple arterial complications and mild kidney failure. Indeed, the patient had coronary artery disease requiring 5 stents, and then the recent peripheral arterial disease treated with embolectomy by Fogarty catheter. During the hospitalization, on April 6th the patient was diagnosed with bilateral interstitial pneumonia (see chest X-ray, Fig. 1 ), that was eventually demonstrated to have been caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of severe hypoxia irrespective of oxygen support through standard Ventimask, the patient had to start non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) with Continuous Positive Air-Pressure (C-PAP) with 60% of Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FIO2) given in 2?h?cycles every 12?h. At this time, his arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and his blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) were 65?mmHg and 93%, respectively; the patient had increased C-reactive protein (CRP, 63?mg/l), increased lactate de-hydrogenase (LDH, 466 UI/L), leukocytosis (16.9?g/L) and lymphocytopenia. Patient's performance status (PS, using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] scale) was 3. In consideration of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2, the patient was considered a candidate for experimental treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), including the complement C3 inhibitor AMY-101, available at the San Raffaele Hospital. AMY-101 is available at the San Raffaele Hospital within a compassionate use program sponsored by Amyndas Pharmaceuticals S.A, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of San Raffaele Hospital on March 25th. On April 8th, the AMY-101 compassionate use was discussed with the patient, who expressed his willingness to be included in the program. After having signed the IRB approved informed consent, the patient was enrolled in the AMY-101 compassionate use program. The patient was not treated with specific antiviral therapy, whereas antibacterial prophylaxis with piperacilline/tazobactam was added 2?days before the start of AMY-101 administration and continued for the entire treatment period. April 10th was the day that the AMY-101 treatment started; at baseline, the patient was in poor general clinical conditions, with severe fatigue, severe tachypnea (>35 respiratory acts per minute), and persistent dry cough. Pulmonary auscultation revealed mid-inspiratory and expiratory coarse crackles, bilateral. He was in severe ARDS, requiring C-PAP cycles (2?h every 12?h) alternating to oxygen support through Ventimask with 60% FIO2. His lung parameters at baseline, with FIO2 60%, were as follows: PaO2 89?mmHg, PaCO2 36?mmHg, SpO2 96%, pH?7,5, PaO2/FIO2 148?mmHg. Blood tests were as follows: white blood cells (WBC) 11.6???109/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 8.6???109/L, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) 1.6???109/L, CRP 94.2?mg/l, LDH 306 UI/l, C3 plasma level 1.81?g/L. Additional lab testing demonstrated mild renal function impairment and grade I transaminase elevation. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score were 15 and 1 (for respiratory rate?>?22/min), respectively. AMY-101 was given intravenously (IV) through a peripheral vein infusion at dose of 5?mg/kg?mg/Kg/day, given as initial loading dose administered in 6?h; no side effects were recorded after the loading dose. Immediately after the completion of the loading dose, 13 maintenance doses were administered as 24-h continuous infusions, for a 14-day treatment period. No infusion reactions were reported during the whole duration of the therapy; notably, the experimental treatment did not worsen renal and hepatic function. After 48?h from the initiation of AMY-101 treatment, the patient showed a dramatic improvement of all parameters that were abnormal at baseline, resulting in the quick resolution of the broad inflammatory response associated with COVID-19. In particular, CRP and LDH progressively normalized, while leukocytosis and lymphocytopenia improved more slowly but progressively (Fig. 2 ). These laboratory findings were associated with a significant improvement of respiratory performance with a gradual decrease of oxygen requirement (Fig. 3 ). Starting from April 18th (Day 9) a progressive weaning from oxygen supplementation was allowed. C-PAP was initially reduced to alternate day cycles, and then discontinued on April 20th (Day 11 of AMY 101 treatment). Similarly to the progressive and continuous improvement of blood tests, the lung function also continued to improve: indeed, the day after C-PAP discontinuation the patient's oxygen requirement diminished, with FIO2 reducing from 40% to 31% and then 28%, without desaturation (Fig. 3). Interestingly, lung functional improvement was not associated with major changes by imaging: indeed, the bilateral interstitial pneumonia was still observed by a chest X-ray performed on April 16th (Day 7), and by a subsequent CT scan performed on April 20th (Day 11), that showed also a mild right pleural effusion. Chest X-ray at enrollment.

He had a meaningful past medical history, due to history of atrial fibrillation (resolved at the time of hospitalization), hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, associated with multiple arterial complications and mild kidney failure. Indeed, the patient had coronary artery disease requiring 5 stents, and then the recent peripheral arterial disease treated with embolectomy by Fogarty catheter. During the hospitalization, on April 6th the patient was diagnosed with bilateral interstitial pneumonia (see chest X-ray, Fig. 1 ), that was eventually demonstrated to have been caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of severe hypoxia irrespective of oxygen support through standard Ventimask, the patient had to start non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) with Continuous Positive Air-Pressure (C-PAP) with 60% of Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FIO2) given in 2?h?cycles every 12?h. At this time, his arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and his blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) were 65?mmHg and 93%, respectively; the patient had increased C-reactive protein (CRP, 63?mg/l), increased lactate de-hydrogenase (LDH, 466 UI/L), leukocytosis (16.9?g/L) and lymphocytopenia. Patient's performance status (PS, using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] scale) was 3. In consideration of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2, the patient was considered a candidate for experimental treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), including the complement C3 inhibitor AMY-101, available at the San Raffaele Hospital. AMY-101 is available at the San Raffaele Hospital within a compassionate use program sponsored by Amyndas Pharmaceuticals S.A, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of San Raffaele Hospital on March 25th. On April 8th, the AMY-101 compassionate use was discussed with the patient, who expressed his willingness to be included in the program. After having signed the IRB approved informed consent, the patient was enrolled in the AMY-101 compassionate use program. The patient was not treated with specific antiviral therapy, whereas antibacterial prophylaxis with piperacilline/tazobactam was added 2?days before the start of AMY-101 administration and continued for the entire treatment period. April 10th was the day that the AMY-101 treatment started; at baseline, the patient was in poor general clinical conditions, with severe fatigue, severe tachypnea (>35 respiratory acts per minute), and persistent dry cough. Pulmonary auscultation revealed mid-inspiratory and expiratory coarse crackles, bilateral. He was in severe ARDS, requiring C-PAP cycles (2?h every 12?h) alternating to oxygen support through Ventimask with 60% FIO2. His lung parameters at baseline, with FIO2 60%, were as follows: PaO2 89?mmHg, PaCO2 36?mmHg, SpO2 96%, pH?7,5, PaO2/FIO2 148?mmHg. Blood tests were as follows: white blood cells (WBC) 11.6???109/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 8.6???109/L, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) 1.6???109/L, CRP 94.2?mg/l, LDH 306 UI/l, C3 plasma level 1.81?g/L. Additional lab testing demonstrated mild renal function impairment and grade I transaminase elevation. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score were 15 and 1 (for respiratory rate?>?22/min), respectively. AMY-101 was given intravenously (IV) through a peripheral vein infusion at dose of 5?mg/kg?mg/Kg/day, given as initial loading dose administered in 6?h; no side effects were recorded after the loading dose. Immediately after the completion of the loading dose, 13 maintenance doses were administered as 24-h continuous infusions, for a 14-day treatment period. No infusion reactions were reported during the whole duration of the therapy; notably, the experimental treatment did not worsen renal and hepatic function. After 48?h from the initiation of AMY-101 treatment, the patient showed a dramatic improvement of all parameters that were abnormal at baseline, resulting in the quick resolution of the broad inflammatory response associated with COVID-19. In particular, CRP and LDH progressively normalized, while leukocytosis and lymphocytopenia improved more slowly but progressively (Fig. 2 ). These laboratory findings were associated with a significant improvement of respiratory performance with a gradual decrease of oxygen requirement (Fig. 3 ). Starting from April 18th (Day 9) a progressive weaning from oxygen supplementation was allowed. C-PAP was initially reduced to alternate day cycles, and then discontinued on April 20th (Day 11 of AMY 101 treatment). Similarly to the progressive and continuous improvement of blood tests, the lung function also continued to improve: indeed, the day after C-PAP discontinuation the patient's oxygen requirement diminished, with FIO2 reducing from 40% to 31% and then 28%, without desaturation (Fig. 3). Interestingly, lung functional improvement was not associated with major changes by imaging: indeed, the bilateral interstitial pneumonia was still observed by a chest X-ray performed on April 16th (Day 7), and by a subsequent CT scan performed on April 20th (Day 11), that showed also a mild right pleural effusion. The X-ray demonstrates a marked improvement of pneumonia with re-expansion of the lungs, bilaterally.","Since January 2020 Elsevier has created a COVID-19 resource centre with free information in English and Mandarin on the novel coronavirus COVID-19.

She underwent bilateral lung transplantation because of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in February 2019. Alemtuzumab was administered as induction therapy, and a dual immunosuppressive regimen consisting of tacrolimus and prednisolone was used as maintenance therapy. Following a complicated post-transplant course, she was discharged 3 months post-operatively. The highest forced expiratory volume at 1 second value was reached in December 2019 with 1.60 liters (72% predicted). On the day of hospitalization (Day 0), she presented to the outpatient clinic for a routine follow-up visit with no apparent symptoms. Lung function testing showed a drop in forced expiratory volume at 1 second to 1.28 liters (57% predicted). Upon questioning, she expressed mild exercise dyspnea and a dry cough but no fever or diarrhea. The patient had no concerning travel history. Immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus 0.6 mg twice daily (trough level was 5?7 ng/dl owing to alemtuzumab induction and history of osteomyelitis), and 5 mg prednisolone daily. Leukocyte count was 11,360 cells/?l (6% lymphocytes), C-reactive protein was 1.0 mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase was 297 units/liter, and creatine kinase was 32 units/liter. There was no thrombocytopenia. Arterial blood had a partial pressure of oxygen of 55 mm Hg without supplementation. Real-time reverse transcriptase?PCR (RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 from Altona Diagnostics) of nasal and pharyngeal swabs showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, thereby establishing a diagnosis of COVID-19. She was hospitalized, and a chest X-ray showed chronic post-operative dystelectasis on the left side with some increase in density (Figure 1 ) compared with December 2019. A chest computerized tomography scan showed ground glass opacities mainly in the left lower lobe with left-sided parenchymal consolidation or partial atelectasis (Figure 2 ). Oxygen supplementation with 1 to 2 liters/minute was administered. Antibacterial therapy was empirically started based on suspected bacterial superinfection. Otherwise, no major changes in medication were performed. A detailed medication plan is shown in Table 1 . She remained asymptomatic and remained stable. RT-PCR testing was performed on a weekly basis and remained positive on Day 7 and Day 14. Cycle threshold levels of SARS-CoV-2 E- and S-gene are provided in Table 2 . Cycle threshold values increased at every sample time point, indicating a decrease in virus levels over time. On nasopharyngeal swabs on Day 21, no SARS-CoV-2-RNA could be detected by RT-PCR. No oxygen was required from Day 17 until discharge. The patient was discharged home on Day 21. Figure 1.

The chest X-ray imaging revealed bilateral infiltration in both upper and lower lobs (Fig. 1a). The patient had no underlying diseases and history of medicine usage. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sample for COVID-19 was reported positive and according to RT-PCR test and clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was made for the patient. The therapeutic regimen included Hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 200 mg P.O. BID and lopinavir/ritonavir at a dose of 200/50 mg P.O. BID initiated for the patient. After four days, the clinical condition of the patient was deteriorated and he was subjected to intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation. The peripheral oxygen saturation decreased to 82%.

The urine output also decreased to 200 mL during the last 12 h and creatinine increased to 1.5 mg/dL. At this time, it is decided to start continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT, Prismaflex, Baxter, IL, USA) with disposable hemoperfusion cartridge (HA 380 cartridge, Jafron Biomedical Co., China) due to cytokine release storm and hypoxemia. A Shaldon catheter was inserted and CRRT was done for three sessions. The CRRT modality was continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The replacement fluid volume was removed by 35 mL/kg/h and the pump circulated blood by 250 mL/min. Priming of hemoperfusion was done with saline, and the cartridge was primed in a vertical position with the arterial side facing downward. A bolus dose of 2500 IU of heparin was administered into the arterial line, the cartridge was kept inlet side down, and blood flow through the cartridge was begun. Totally, 6000 IU was needed through the procedure. CRRT was started with a high ultrafiltration rate (200 mL/h). Each cartridge was replaced with a new cartridge after 6 h. The fluid removal rate was decreased to 50 mL/h after 8 h and then to zero mL/h during the last 8 h in the first 24 h. The second and the third sessions of CRRT were conducted by 0 mL/h fluid removal. A 24-h rest between sessions, was considered to avoid the probable coagulopathy and electrolyte abnormality. After three sessions of CRRT plus hemopurification, the clinical condition of the patient was improved with the peripheral oxygen saturation of 95%. The creatinine also decreased to 1.1 mg/dL after the end of CRRT and urine output reached to 70 mL/h. No laboratory abnormality was seen during the CRRT. The chest X-ray revealed recovery of both lungs following the completion of 3 sessions of hemopurification (Fig. 1c). Also, the inflammatory cytokines were measured 48 h following the last session of hemoperfusion and showed a remarkable decrease. IL-1, and IL-6 were decreased from 523.3 pg/mL to 38.25 pg/mL, and 226.35 pg/mL to 210.18 pg/mL, respectively. The measurements also showed the decrease in IL-8 from 886.5 pg/mL to 482.4 pg/mL.

She suffered from hypertension and postencephalitic epilepsy. When she was 76, the patient developed a Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. The initial presentation of the herpetic encephalitis were repetitive oral buccal automatisms and aphasia lasting 6 h associated with the electroencephalographic findings of subcontinuous epileptiform discharges over the left temporal fields, configuring a non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). The status epilepticus was successfully treated with a sequence of antiepileptic drugs. Because of the encephalitis, fluent aphasia and mild right limbs weakness persisted, with only a partial recovery after neuro-rehabilitation. Since then, the patient was steadily under treatment with valproic acid and levetiracetam and remained seizure-free for more than two years. She was under regular neurologic follow-up and the last electroencephalogram performed ten days prior to admission was normal (Fig. 1, label A). In the morning of 12th March 2020, the patient developed a focal status epilepticus without any prodromal symptoms. First Aid evaluation showed alert, eupnoeic patient with normal body temperature (36.1 �C). The neurological examination showed fluent aphasia, right central facial nerve palsy, pronation of the right arm and drift of the right leg. The patient displayed ongoing myoclonic jerks of the right eyelid and upper-lip, started two hours before. She was treated with intravenous valproic acid, followed by intravenous midazolam for the persistence of subintrant focal seizures. The electroencephalogram revealed semi-rhythmic, irregular, high amplitude delta activity, predominantly lateralized over the left fronto-centro-temporal regions, consistent with focal status epilepticus (Fig. 1, labels B and C). The antiepileptic treatment resolved the status epilepticus (Fig. 1, label D). Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain was negative for acute lesions. Brain MRI confirmed extensive gliosis and atrophy involving the left temporo-parietal lobe, in the absence of new cerebral lesions as documented by both diffusion weighted imaging and post-gadolinium sequences (Fig. 2, labels A�D). The chest X-ray was unremarkable (Fig. 2, label E). Laboratory analysis revealed lymphocytopenia (560 cells/mm3) and thrombocytopenia (125,000/mm3). Twelve hours after the admission to the Emergency Room, the patient developed fever. She did not exhibit respiratory symptoms, such as cough or dyspnoea. Her blood oxygenation was normal. The blood analysis showed a further decrease in the white cells and platelets count. The C-reactive protein was 29.7 mg/L, procalcitonine was 0.07 ng/mL. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, her fever did not improve. Blood cultures and urine culture were negative for common bacteria, fungi and neurotropic viruses. The epidemiological survey revealed that in the previous week the patient met her son, who went into preventive isolation afterwards for being in contact with three people with a positive swab for SARS-CoV-2. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs specimen of the patient were then obtained and Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed, which tested positive for SARS-CoV2. The patient was transferred to the Infectious Disease Unit and treated with lopinavir-ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine. After initiation of the treatment, the clinical conditions of the patient improved, with resolution of the fever. A further chest X-ray (Fig. 2, label F) and a lung ultrasound were negative for interstitial pneumonia. Since then, no other seizures occurred. During the hospitalization, she did not require oxygen therapy. On 28th March she was discharged in stable condition, afebrile after two negative swabs for SARS-CoV-2.

On February 4, 2020, a 50-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of “fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia,” and she was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Fever Clinic of Xiangyang First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei Medical College. The patient had a five-day business trip in Wuhan (from January 22, 2020, to January 27, 2020). Fever initially occurred on January 28, 2020, with a body temperature of 38.5°C, with dry cough and muscle ache. On January 30, 2020, the patient went to Xiangyang First People’s Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for consultation in the respiratory department, and the laboratory test reported that the influenza A virus serology was negative. The results of blood routine examination were normal [white blood cell count (WBC): 5.1×109/l; neutrophil percentage (neu%): 69.2%; lymphocyte percentage (lym%): 25.6%; lymphocyte absolute value (lym): 1.28×109/l; C-reactive protein (CRP): 6.1 mg/l] and she was given Tamiflu (75 mg/time, twice per day) orally and was rehydrated. Three days later (on February 2, 2020), the patient still had dry cough, so she went to hospital (TCM) again. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip and a novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was performed and it was negative. At admission, chest X-ray showed increased and thickened right lower lung markings, which suggested bronchitis and possible interstitial pneumonia according to her positive family history of interstitial pneumonia (Figure 1). Levofloxacin was given drip once for intravenous treatment, and Tamiflu was continued to be taken orally. On February 04, 2020, the patient's symptoms were still not improved, and her body temperature continued to rise to 39.2°C. She was referred to our fever clinic for further evaluation, and a chest computed tomography (CT) was performed.
